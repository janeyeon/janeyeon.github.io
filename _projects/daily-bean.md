Corruption is an experimental computer game whose universe is the code for the game itself, and which is slowly being corrupted. The player must try to fight the progress of corruption by deleting troublesome pieces of code, while taking care not to destroy their own capacity to exist.

The game can be played online [here](https://omgwac.com/corruption/). The source code is [available on Github](https://github.com/SamAdamDay/corruption).
