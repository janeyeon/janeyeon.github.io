HI! ðŸ‘‹ I am Hayeon Kim, a passionate researcher and developer specializing in cutting-edge generative AI technologies. Currently pursuing my M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Seoul National University, [ICL](https://icl.snu.ac.kr), my work focuses on multimodal generative AI, including high-dimensional image, video, and 3D/4D content generation. My academic journey is complemented by hands-on experience in iOS app development and product management, where I led projects like the award-winning [DailyBean app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dailybean-simplest-journal/id1553223828).

You can [download my CV here]({% link /assets/pdf/CV.pdf %}).

The following are broadly my current research interests. See also my [list of
publications](/publications).
- [Large scene generation](https://janeyeon.github.io/beyond-scene/)
- [Image restoration](https://janeyeon.github.io/colora/)
- [Multi dimension output(3D, 4D)](https://janeyeon.github.io/ditto-nerf/)
