My paper [BeyondScene: Higher-Resolution Human-Centric Scene Generation With Pretrained Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04544) and [Contribution-based Low-Rank Adaptation with Pre-training Model for Real Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.01099) have been accepted for publication at the [ECCV Conference](https://eccv.ecva.net).
